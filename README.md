# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


# purpose 
The website opens to the current day with blocks of time from 7am to 6pm for standard business hours. It allows input of text for each hour.
The lock at the right of the text block is clicked and closed to save the details to the page that will remain
even when the website is refreshed. The past time is in gray. The current time is in red, and the future time is in green.
